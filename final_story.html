			<p>Since its abrupt arrival in 2020, COVID-19 has made changes to every industry.  In the restaurant business, DoorDash and Grubhub took over.  In retail, ecommerce became the new norm.  Even doctors were able to move their daily operations to the telehealth space.</p>
			<p>While alternatives formed for many businesses adapting to a pandemic lifestyle, the entertainment industry suffered as a whole.  Virtual concerts and outdoor shows were possible solutions for some businesses, but movie theaters were at a loss.  How could theaters compete with the comfort of the couch?  What could be safer and more sanitary than one’s own home?</p>

			<h3>The 2020 Effect</h3>
			<p>Movie theaters felt the pain of these questions not long after the start of mask wearing and social distancing.  According to <a href="https://my.ibisworld.com/" target="_blank">IBISWorld's</a> <a href="https://my.ibisworld.com/us/en/industry/51213/about" target="_blank">Industry Report for Movie Theaters in the U.S.</a>, the annual revenue of movie theaters dropped 73% from 2019 to 2020.  This decrease in revenue amounted to $15 billion and shattered industry leaders like AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and Cinemark Holdings, Inc.</p>

			<p>With closures and bankruptcy looming, movie theater companies had more to worry about than just themselves.  When theater revenue started falling, streaming services were the next shoulder for consumers to cry on.</p>
			<p>According to an article on <a href="https://screenrant.com/streaming-services-2020-growth-pandemic-subscribers/" target="-blank"><i>Screen Rant</i></a>, Disney+ hit 73 million subscribers in the year 2020, when business analysts thought it would take until 2022 for the service to hit even 50 million subscribers.  Other corporations like Netflix and Hulu added to this growth to make an impressive 37% increase in the market for streaming services in 2020.</p>
			<p>Streaming’s strength in the peak of the pandemic could have been enough for movie theaters to throw the towel in and call it quits.  But Evan Smith, a professor in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, said that was not quite the case.</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Streaming Growth Slows Down</h3>
			<p>Smith, who was a development executive in television as well as a screenwriter, now teaches a film business class in the Newhouse School.  He said he has always had an interest in the business and distribution ends of the industry, which have led him to teach the course on “dollars and deals” in film.</p>
			<p>Even though streaming services hit their stride in 2020, Smith said the “dollars and deals” in subscriber growth began to slow down over time.</p>
			<p>“Streaming networks were investing tons of money in original content, in order to create and enhance their subscriber base, so that they could compete and become one of the few surviving streamers five or 10 years down the road,” Smith explained.  While they knew content is what sets companies apart, services like Netflix and Disney+ realized that it was not enough to present this original content only on their platforms.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>A Restructured Business Model</h3>
			<p>“They needed to find a new business model that is sort of more down the middle,” Smith said, which has led streaming networks to consider theatrical distribution as part of their business plan.</p>
			<p>Some companies like Apple and Amazon have embraced this model, while others like Netflix have been notably resistant to the movement.  But as the two sides of the business grow to recognize the importance of their relationship, they have had to rethink the logistics of the structure.</p>
			<div class="list">
				<h5>Path of Film Distribution Before COVID-19</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>Theaters for 90-day screening</li>
					<li>Pay-per-view and streaming</li>
					<li>TV networks</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>In the past, Smith said there has been a consistent sequence for film distribution that provides revenue from a series of platforms throughout the lifetime of a film.  First, a movie is released into theaters and is screened for around 90 days, followed by a pay-per-view and streaming period.  Finally, broadcast syndication would take place, which means that certain television stations purchase the rights to distribute a film on their network.</p>
			<p>While this system used to be successful, movie studios began to think that content needs to be available to consumers on all platforms as soon as possible. “So, the movie distributors were pressuring the movie theaters to collapse or condense the windows during which the movie theaters had exclusive right to show their show movies,” Smith said.</p>
			<p>This pressure has been present for the past 10 years, but the push from streaming services since the pandemic has ignited the change.  Theaters will face new economic problems as their exclusive rights to films are cut short, but the relationship is too beneficial to skip out on.</p>

			<h3>Theaters on the Comeback</h3>
			<p>Regardless of the restructuring coming to the distribution and exhibition sides of film, Smith said streaming companies now know to “not overlook the theatrical release component.”  In an optimistic turn of events, trade articles now preach the narrative that movie theaters are back.</p>
			<p> “2022 has seen the industry bounce back,” Smith said.  “Not to what it used to be, but quite a bit.”  From 2020 to 2022, there was almost a 58% increase in movie theater revenue.  While 2022’s $8.7 billion revenue does not exactly hit theaters’ pre-pandemic glory, Smith felt it’s enough to make the industry pretty happy.</p>

			<p>In March 2023, the Cinema Foundation released its <a href="https://www.thecinemafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/State-of-the-Cinema-Industry-March-2023.pdf" target="_blank">“State of the Cinema Industry” report</a>. The report coins 2022 as “A Year of Rebuilding and Growth” and shows how the number of screens, employees, and wide releases were affected by COVID-19.  The National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) <a href="https://www.natoonline.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO)</a> shared a similar story at <a href="https://cinemacon.com/" target="_blank">CinemaCon</a> 2023.  NATO’s official convention, which took place April 24-27 in Las Vegas, NV, brought light to the recent success of all aspects of the film industry, including the comeback of the exhibition side of movies.  
			<p>Movie theaters might not be back to their pre-pandemic strength just yet.  However, there is hope within the industry for a return to success that seems to be already underway.</p>
			<p>The couch and TV remote have been a go-to for movies for the past three years.  But according to the professionals, it’s about time to get back to the big screen with a popcorn and soda in hand for the latest release.</p>
